# FNAF-Python
This is an opensource python version of FNAF with two functional animatronics (they wake up at 2AM), their screamers, win ending and out-of-power ending.
If you want to edit the game code, download fnaf1.py file and extract .zip file with images, fonts and music to the same directory (from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1au-NWoCx39n0XESl8hWge4uRqTP38aU6/view?usp=sharing). Then you will be able to run the game from a code editor or IDE and add any features you want :) 
I will be glad to see any changes in the game, good luck!
